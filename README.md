## Overview

Welcome to the HRI Project on Emotional Support Evaluation with NAO Robot. This project is dedicated to understanding and comparing the effectiveness of emotional support offered by NAO robots and human interactions.

## Project Goals

1. **Emotional Impact Analysis:** Quantify the impact of NAO and human emotional support for specific emotions.
2. **Assess Comfort Levels:** Evaluate the comfort experienced by participants during interactions.
3. **Communication and Interaction:** Analyze the clarity of communication and interaction from both NAO and humans.
4. **Overall Satisfaction Measurement:** Determine participants' general satisfaction with emotional support.
5. **Personal Preference Insights:** Identify participants' inclinations for seeking emotional support from NAO or humans.
6. **Comparative Analysis:** Compare scores and discern patterns between NAO and human emotional support.
7. **Drawing Conclusive Insights:** Arrive at clear conclusions about the proficiency of emotional support sources and pinpoint areas for improvement.

## Preliminary Precautions

- **Consent from Participants:** Obtain clear and informed consent from all participants.
- **Presence of Caregiver or Observer:** Ensure the presence of caregivers or observers for participant safety.
- **Controlled Environment:** Maintain a controlled environment for distraction-free emotional support sessions.

# Work Done Thus Far

- Emotional response code for NAO for various emotions.
- Developed a participant list for the project.
- Created a questionnaire to facilitate in-depth comparative analysis.
- Designed a Google Form for data collection.
